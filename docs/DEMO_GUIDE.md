## Key Technical Features to Highlight

### 1. Adaptive Learning Algorithm
```python
# Show in backend/main.py lines 150-165
if session.consecutive_correct >= 3:
    # User is doing well, increase difficulty
    if difficulty == "easy": difficulty = "medium"
    elif difficulty == "medium": difficulty = "hard"
elif session.consecutive_incorrect >= 2:
    # User is struggling, decrease difficulty
    if difficulty == "hard": difficulty = "medium"
    elif difficulty == "medium": difficulty = "easy"
```

### 2. Real-time Feedback System
- **Frontend**: Immediate visual feedback
- **Backend**: Detailed explanations stored in database
- **Integration**: Seamless API communication

### 3. Motivation Engine
```python
# Show in backend/main.py lines 250-280
if accuracy >= 80:
    if session.consecutive_correct >= 3:
        return {"message": "Incredible! You're on fire! üî•"}
    else:
        return {"message": "Excellent work! You're mastering these concepts! ‚≠ê"}
```

### 4. Session Management
- **Unique session IDs**: `session_20231201_143022_1234`
- **Performance tracking**: Accuracy, streaks, difficulty progression
- **Database persistence**: SQLite for MVP simplicity

## Architecture Highlights

### Frontend (React)
- **Component-based**: Modular, reusable components
- **State management**: React Context + useReducer
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS for responsive design
- **API integration**: Axios for backend communication

### Backend (FastAPI)

- **Data validation**: Pydantic models
- **Database**: SQLite with proper schema
- **CORS**: Configured for frontend communication

### Database Design
```sql
-- Questions table
CREATE TABLE questions (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    question_text TEXT NOT NULL,
    options TEXT NOT NULL,        -- JSON array
    correct_answer TEXT NOT NULL,
    explanation TEXT NOT NULL,
    difficulty TEXT NOT NULL,
    topic TEXT NOT NULL
);

-- User responses tracking
CREATE TABLE user_responses (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    session_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    question_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    user_answer TEXT NOT NULL,
    is_correct BOOLEAN NOT NULL,
    time_taken REAL,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

- Show enthusiasm for the educational potential

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Backend won't start**: Check Python version and dependencies
2. **Frontend won't start**: Verify Node.js version and npm install
3. **API errors**: Check if backend is running on port 8000
4. **Database issues**: Verify SQLite file creation

### Quick Fixes
```bash
# Reset database
rm backend/impulse.db
# Restart backend to recreate tables

# Clear npm cache
cd frontend
npm cache clean --force
npm install

# Check ports
lsof -i :8000  # Backend
lsof -i :3000  # Frontend
```
